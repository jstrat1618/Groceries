# Purpose
I created this project in part to manage my groceries and to practice my python, SQL, and interfacing the two.

# Inputing Grocery lists
Input a grocery list in a two column csv file with headers "recipe" and "servings". See grocery_list.csv for practice.

# SQL
You can find the queries to create the tables in the SQL folder. You can also find queries to insert categories and two recipes (pb & j and a hummus veggie sandwich).
